I have edited flow.tcl, which contained the full description of the physical design flow, to include only up to the floorplan and placement stage, and updated verilog_descriptive.tcl to point to the new flow_floorplan_placement.tcl file.

like in general:
```
# flow_floorplan_placement.tcl
# ---------------------------------
# OpenROAD physical design flow: up to floorplan and placement

puts "Starting Floorplan and Placement Stage..."

# Read libraries
read_libraries $lib_path

# Read Verilog
read_verilog $top_module

# Link design
link_design $top_module

# Read SDC constraints
read_sdc $sdc_file

# Initialize floorplan
initialize_floorplan -site $site -die_area $die_area -core_area $core_area

# Placement
place_design

# Save intermediate design
write_def "design_after_placement.def"
puts "Floorplan and Placement complete."


```

```
# verilog_descriptive.tcl
# ---------------------------------
# Main design flow for this project

puts "Starting OpenROAD flow..."

# Source the floorplan + placement module
source "flow_floorplan_placement.tcl"

# Continue with the rest of the flow if needed
# e.g., CTS, routing, final layout
# source "flow_cts_routing.tcl"
```
